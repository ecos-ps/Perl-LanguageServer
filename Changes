        - Default debug configuration is now automatically provided without
          the need to create a launch.json first (#103)
        - Add Option cacheDir to specify location of cache dir (#113)

        - Fix: Debugger outputted invalid thread reference causes "no such coroutine" message, 
          so watchs and code from the debug console is not expanded properly
        - Fix: LanguageServer hangs when multiple request send at once from VSCode to LanguageServer
        - Fix: cwd parameter for debugger in launch.json had no effect (#99)

        - Fix: sshArgs parameter was not declared as array (#109)

          until handling of childs processes is fixed
